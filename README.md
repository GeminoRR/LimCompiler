# LimCompiler
#Intro
Lim Compiler is the programming language compiler I am creating.
Please don't look at my horrible code.

#The difference between other languages and Lim
- Different management of references
- Statically Typed
- Minimal Runtime
- Object-oriented programming
- Handle statement with indentation
- Compiles to C, Executable Windows and Linux (later wasm)
